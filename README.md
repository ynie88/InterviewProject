<h2>Exercise 1</h2>

Create an unordered list of 100 where it will print the number on the console. 

However, if it's divisible by 3, print "<b>Fizz</b>" on the console. 

If it's divisible by 5, print "<b>Buzz</b>" on the console. 

Finally, if it's divisible by both 3 and 5 then it'll print "<b>FizzBuzz</b>" on the console.

<h2>Excercise 2</h2>

Instructions on running the project: navigate to the project from a terminal window, and type in "<b>gulp connect</b>" to run the project. Then open the project from a browser at <a href="http://localhost:8005">http://localhost:8005</a>. 

Currently, if the user clicks on the button, the app calls a function bound to the scope within the controller through the directive ng-click. 

What we want is a custom, reuseable directive with its own scope that calls a function from the html in the controller <b>when the user clicks on the directive with the attribute</b>. Also, it should call the function <b>"additionalFunction"</b>, also in the controller.

<b>Bonus:</b> Hide the button once it has been clicked.
